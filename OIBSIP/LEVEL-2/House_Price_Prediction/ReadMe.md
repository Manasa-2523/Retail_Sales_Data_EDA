Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
📖 Project Overview
House prices are influenced by many factors — location, size, number of rooms, and more. In this project, we build a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset of relevant features.

Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

🎯 Goals
Collect and prepare a dataset with numerical features and a target variable (house price)

Explore and clean the dataset to ensure quality

Select relevant features that contribute to accurate predictions

Train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn

Evaluate model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared

Visualize predicted vs. actual values to interpret results

🛠️ Key Steps
Get the Data → Load the dataset with house features and prices

Clean & Explore → Fix missing values, check distributions, and understand the data

Pick Features → Choose the most important factors (like size, rooms, location)

Train the Model → Apply Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn

Test & Evaluate → Measure accuracy with metrics like MSE and R²

Visualize Results → Plot predicted vs. actual prices to see how well the model works

📚 Learning Objectives
